# The Australian Federal Legislation Database (1901-2021)

A repository to provide the Acts and their Amendments from the Federal Register of Legislation in simple machine readable format.

In the secure outputs folder is the most recent data. Some initial analysis in the form of graphs are provided in the outputs folders.

Please let me know if you find any errors! 

I'm working on an R Package and a paper. 

For now, if you use the data, please cite using the 'citation.bib' file.
